Here is what happens when iconic American speeches are run through Grammarly to add "constructive criticism."

[Grammarly](http://www.grammarly.com) is an online grammar correcting website. Texts from JFK's first inaugural speech, MLK's "I Have a Dream" speech, Nixon's "Silent Majority" speech, the Gettysburg Address, and Lou Gehrig's farwell speech were pasted into the trial portion of Grammarly. The results were caputred as images.
